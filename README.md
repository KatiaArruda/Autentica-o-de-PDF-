The PDF authentication project with CPF is a webpage where users can upload a PDF file and enter a CPF number. They can select the color and position (bottom left, bottom right, top left, or top right) on the PDF where the CPF will be printed. After generating the document, the CPF number will be visible in the selected color and position.

I developed this project during one of the Python classes in the OneBitCode community.
